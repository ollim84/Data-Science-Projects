# Data-Science-Projects

This repository includes various projects related to data science that I have worked with. I plan to inclue the repository with the following types of projects:

* Data Cleaning Project - shows how to take multiple messy data sets, clean them up, combine them and use them to perform analysis. 

* Data Storytelling Project - shows how to extract insights from data, communicate these insights and reason with data. 

* Data Visualization Project - shows how to communicate data visually using appropriate plots and charts.

* Machine Learning Project - shows how to effectively build a model that makes accurate predictions with data
