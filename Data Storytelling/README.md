This work focuses on visualizing the gender gap across college degrees, using the 
annually released dataset by The Department of Education Statistics containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees 
granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.

Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website:

The project will generate line charts to compare across all degree categories. In the last step of the project, 
the final diagram is exported as an image file.
